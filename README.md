# Heterogeneous Datasets for Federated Survival Analysis Simulation

This repo contains three algorithms for constructing realistic federated datasets for survival analysis.
Each algorithm starts from an existing non-federated dataset and assigns each sample to a specific client in the federation.
The algorithms are
* ```uniform_split```: assigns each sample to a random client with uniform probability;
* ```quantity_skewed_split```: assigns each sample to a random client according to the Dirichlet distribution [3, 4];
* ```label_skewed_split```: assigns each sample to a time bin, then assigns a set of samples from each bin to the clients according to the Dirichlet distribution [3, 4].

For more information, please take a look at our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12166) [1].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Federated Survival Datasets is built on top of [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). 
To install those libraries you can run

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To import survival datasets in your project, we strongly recommend [SurvSet](https://github.com/ErikinBC/SurvSet) [2], a comprehensive collection of more than 70 survival datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from federated_survival_datasets import label_skewed_split

# import a survival dataset and extract the input array X and the output array y
df = pd.read_csv("metabric.csv")
X = df[[f"x{i}" for i in range(9)]].to_numpy()
y = np.array([(e, t) for e, t in zip(df["event"], df["time"])], dtype=[("event", bool), ("time", float)])

# run the splitting algorithm
client_data = label_skewed_split(num_clients=8, X=X, y=y)

# check the number of samples assigned to each client
for i, (X_c, y_c) in enumerate(client_data):
    print(f"Client {i} - X: {X_c.shape}, y: {y_c.shape}")
```

We provide an [example notebook](https://github.com/archettialberto/federated_survival_datasets/blob/main/example/example_usage.ipynb) to illustrate the proposed algorithms.
It requires [scikit-survival](https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
